link navbar to log and sign up 

do lab 

Setup routes
Then setup up components for routes
Filling out the basics
Create a component that says its act
Make 
Set up api
Set up database
Put in authentication
Test log in register routes


Set up authentication system for register
    This includes adding the registered user into the DATABASE 
        by writing the registered method that was in the lab
        I need to figure out the flow for it is it just
            set up method
            call method in routes
            then add route to middleware?
    And hashing the password using bycrypt

we need to finish up my log in where registering on there puts it in the database



We need to setup nutrition How?
    similar to routes but user_id refrences the other one he did it using the username refrences where the username refrencing
    gets it and makes it so that when it grabs the info from  
    the whole point is to make a certain user associated with certain nutrition


step by step is best
    do it how they do it in labs but instead grab info from your nutritions table


    July 14 9:14 on step 5 of lab finish lab by end of day working test after each implemented video
    Tested stuff that works:
        get request for auth/me 
        can get token using auth/me
        post request for auth/login
        post request for auth/register
        hashed password
        /nutrition route works in insomnia



For  Front end
    using jastor figure out how he puts in data from frontend and takes it to the database from register
    how he takes data from login to authenticate it
    he will probably teach both in lab
